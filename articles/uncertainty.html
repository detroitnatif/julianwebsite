                Uncertainty is the feeling which makes your stomach turn, mind race, and palms clam. Everyones felt it, and many have crumbled under it. As one subjects themself to the unknown, the mind tries to construct the outcome using every life experience which came before. This constant prediction is innately human and has been developed for millennia in order to protect the individual. However, it is easy for oneself to “prepare” for every situation and take away from the beauty the unknown provides and growth which is fostered within it. Becoming comfortable does not stem from knowing everything which is bound to happen, but by readying oneself to be adaptive and flexible no matter the circumstances.

                Within the Islamic tradition, the word describing this is Inshallah, embodying the fate which every human is subject to and surrendering to the greater powers which create and destroy. Followers live within this framework, and reconcile themselves with God’s will. The strength which comes from accepting your fate forces the individual to live within the moment, and slow down the predictive nature engrained which the human brain is programmed to do. I am grateful to have spent time in the beautiful country of Morocco and experienced the firsthand effects which this belief system fosters. Before meeting my host families each time, the unknown of where I will be living, what my room will look like, and who will be living there fleeted my thoughts. My brain certainly imagined an instance which was not suitable, but you come to realize you are simply programmed to think of the worst possible outcome. The Moroccan families I have had the opportunity to live with were all incredible and taught me to slow down and accept whatever may be thrown my way. As I begin to mature, I realize it is not a linear process determined by the days lived on this Earth, but rather a compilation of every learned lesson creating the perspective which I view the world with.
